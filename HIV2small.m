% The introduction should start by describing the situation in Papua New
% Guinea. Much of this can be lifted from Richard's introduction. 
% We can start introducing the model in the Introduction, preferably with
% references. We can come up with quotes about what a discrete
% compartmental model is.

% Discuss the list of modifications to the model simply and briefly, after
% describing the main model. 

% Plot HIV levels overall

%   Plot the default intervention against the no-intervention case. 
%   Plot the syphilis results for the no-intervention and intervention
%   cases together, on the left in aggregate, and on the right separated by
%   sub-population. The sub-pop plot could have colours by sub-pop and line
%   styles by intervention/baseline. We will need to do the pops 1 and 2
%   separately.
%   Because this is a results section, we don't put in much explanatory
%   text in between, then give the HIV results, similarly. 
%   Next, we can start showing some choise resultsfrom the Sensitivities
%   cases. We could include a table, and put the graphs in the Appendix if
%   at all. We would put the baseline and default interventions at the top
%   of the table. We could list 1. the overall decrease in syphilis 2. the
%   overall decrease in HIV 3. the time it takes to reach 10% of the way
%   from the new equilibrium after the start of the intervention. Then we
%   could include a separate table in the Appendix containing a breakdown
%   by sub-pop of the effects of each intervention.
